# college-signup-form

When downloaded, this code expects a csv file of the form:
'first name', 'second name', 'zID or NIDA ID', 'room number'
named 'zIDFile.csv' in the same directory.

If your csv deviates from these fields, you will likely need to change parts of arcForm.cgi and cnAttendance.pl.

Make sure permissions are set properly to allow the cgi script to be run.
Feel free to copy and change whatever code you want.
